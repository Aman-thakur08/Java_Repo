/*
 * Abstract Class:
 * -An Abstract class must declared with an abstract keyword
 * 
 * - Abstracting is a process of hiding the implementation details
 * and showing only functionality (function declaration) to the user.
 * -cannot make object of abstract class directly,but through derived class [cannot be instance]
 * 
 *  -Example of abstract method?
 *  -Abstract Class may contain abstract and non-abstract
 *  (0-100%) abstract methods can be there:
 *  
 *  In class of Inheritance :100% abstract methods should be there:
 *  Final Class:
 *  The main purpose of using a class being declared as final is to prevent the class from being used.
 *  -If a class is marked as final then no class can inherit any feature from final class.
 *  -you cannot extend a final class.If you try it gives you a compile time error.
