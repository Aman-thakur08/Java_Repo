 * What is Multiprocessing?

 * What is Concurrent Processing?
 * 
 *Program counter holds the address of next instruction to be executed by some processing unit
 * What is Multitasking?
 * Sequential multitasking
 * parallel multitasking
 * 
 * concurrent Multitasking
 * 
 * 
 * Users:MultiThreading task
 * - it is the users job to find out the independent task of the process.
 * - you found t1,t2,t3 and t4 tasks of process T1 out of 8 total tasks.
 * - context switching between  these task  and the worst time is not decided by the user instead JVM will decide this all.
 * - MultiThreading is applied only when concurrent multitasking occurs
 * - JVM does not work until the thread is started by user
 * - it is users job to put these independent codes into their respective threads (T1,T2,T3,T4)
 * - user have to start these threads by 
 * 	- T1.start()
 * 	- T2.start()
 *  - T3.start()
 *  - T4.start()
